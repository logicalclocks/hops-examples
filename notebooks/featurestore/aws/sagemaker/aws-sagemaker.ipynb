    "The Hopsworks Feature Store is an open platform that connects to the largest number of data stores, and data science platforms with the most comprehensive API support - Python, Spark (Python, Java/Scala). \n",
    "It supports AWS SageMaker for feature engineering and as your data science platform. You can design and ingest features and you can browse existing features,  along with creating training datasets as either DataFrames or as files on AWS S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "In order to follow this tutorial, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hopsworks Feature Store running on https://hopsworks.ai. You can register for free with no credit-card and receive $4000 USD of credits to get started. You can deploy a feature store in either your own Azure account or even in an AWS account.\n",
    "- Users should also have an existing SageMaker environment.\n",
    "- The feature store tour project within Hopsworks. The notebook is designed to be used in combination with the Feature Store Tour on Hopsworks.\n"
