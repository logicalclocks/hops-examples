    " \n",
    "The notebook is designed to be used in combination with the Feature Store Tour on Hopsworks, it assumes that you have run the following feature engineering job: [job](https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-examples/tree/master/featurestore) (**the job is added automatically when you start the feature store tour in Hopsworks. You can run the job by going to the 'Jobs' tab to the left in the Hopsworks project home page**). \n",

    "## Feature Store 101\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to think about the feature store is as a central place to store curated /features/ within an organization. A feature is a measurable property of some phenomenon. It could be for example an image-pixel, a word from a piece of text, the age of a person, a coordinate emitted from a sensor, or an aggregate value like the average number of purchases within the last hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature store is a data management layer for machine learning that can optimize the machine learning workflow and provide an interface between data engineering and data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Feature Store Overview](./images/overview.png \"Feature Store Overview\")\n",
    "\n",
    "A feature store is not a pure service concept, it goes hand-in-hand with feature computation. Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into a format that is compatible and understandable for predictive models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two interfaces to the feature store:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing to the feature store, at the end of the feature engineering pipeline the features are written to the feature store, e.g:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "val rawData = spark.read.format(\"csv\").load(filename)\n",
    "val polynomialFeatures = rawData.map((x: Float) => scala.math.pow(x, 2))\n",
    "import io.hops.util.Hops\n",
    "Hops.insertIntoFeaturegroup(\n",
    "    polynomialFeatures, \n",
    "    spark, \n",
    "    \"polynomial_features\",\n",

    "    corrMethod, \n",
    "    numClusters\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Reading from the feature store, to train a model on a set of features, the features can be read from the feature store, e.g:\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "import io.hops.util.Hops\n",
    "val features = List(\"team_budget\", \"average_attendance\", \"average_player_age\")\n",
    "val featuresDf = Hops.getFeatures(spark, features, Hops.getProjectFeaturestore)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data engineer/data scientist, you can think of the feature store as a middle-layer. Once you have computed a set of features, instead of writing them locally to a csv file, insert them in the feature store so that the features can get documented/versioned, backfilled, **and so that your colleagues can re-use your features!** "
