    "## The `hops` python module\n",
    "\n",
    "`hops` is a helper library for Hops that facilitates development by hiding the complexity of running applications and iteracting with services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a feature request or encountered an issue? Please let us know on <a href=\"https://github.com/logicalclocks/hops-util-py\">github</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `experiment` module\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to run your Machine Learning code in Hopsworks, the code for the whole program needs to be provided and put inside a wrapper function. Everything, from importing libraries to reading data and defining the model and running the program needs to be put inside a wrapper function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `experiment` module provides an api to Python programs such as TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch on a Hopsworks on any number of machines and GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Experiment could be a single Python program, which we refer to as an **Experiment**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search or genetic hyperparameter optimization such as differential evolution which runs several Experiments in parallel, which we refer to as **Parallel Experiment**. \n",
    "\n",
    "ParameterServerStrategy, CollectiveAllReduceStrategy and MultiworkerMirroredStrategy making multi-machine/multi-gpu training as simple as invoking a function for orchestration. This mode is referred to as **Distributed Training**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `tensorboard` module\n",
    "The `tensorboard` module allow us to get the log directory for summaries and checkpoints to be written to the TensorBoard we will see in a bit. The only function that we currently need to call is `tensorboard.logdir()`, which returns the path to the TensorBoard log directory. Furthermore, the content of this directory will be put in as a Dataset in your project's Experiments folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directory could in practice be used to store other data that should be accessible after the experiment is finished.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use this module to get the TensorBoard logdir\n",
    "from hops import tensorboard\n",
    "tensorboard_logdir = tensorboard.logdir()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the `hdfs` module\n",
    "The `hdfs` module provides a method to get the path in HopsFS where your data is stored, namely by calling `hdfs.project_path()`. The path resolves to the root path for your project, which is the view that you see when you click `Data Sets` in HopsWorks. To point where your actual data resides in the project you to append the full path from there to your Dataset. For example if you create a mnist folder in your Resources Dataset, the path to the mnist data would be `hdfs.project_path() + 'Resources/mnist'`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Use this module to get the path to your project in HopsFS, then append the path to your Dataset in your project\n",
    "from hops import hdfs\n",
    "project_path = hdfs.project_path()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Downloading the mnist dataset to the current working directory\n",
    "from hops import hdfs\n",
    "mnist_hdfs_path = hdfs.project_path() + \"Resources/mnist\"\n",
    "local_mnist_path = hdfs.copy_to_local(mnist_hdfs_path)\n",
    "```\n",
